The previous version of my portfolio was created using GatsbyJS. Although Gatsby was useful and allowed me to expand my knowledge on React and GraphQL, I felt that it was a bit overkill for a few pages and a handful of images. 

I'm always scrolling through my Twitter feed and one evening came across a tweet of someone looking for SSG suggestions. As expected, Gatsby appeared a number of times in the suggestions, but one suggestion I saw just as much was 11ty/Eleventy. I hadn't heard of Eleventy so decided to head over to the docs and have a little read. 

I'm not sure if it's just me, or if anyone else does this, but when I'm learning/reading about a new bit of kit, I like to see what people have created with it first. I had an intensive look at the [leaderboards](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/) to see what other developers had used Eleventy for. I was impressed! The lighthouse results were crazy, with majority of examples scoring near enough 100 on each section. 

Here are my current Lighthouse scores after using Eleventy. I'm still learning and hopefully a client of mine will let me migrate their current 5 page WordPress site to Eleventy.
