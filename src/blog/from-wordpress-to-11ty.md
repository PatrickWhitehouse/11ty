# Migrating an existing clients site from WordPress to 11ty

The first question I might be asked about this is, why? Simply put, WordPress was a bit overkill for a 5 page site which contained one image (the logo in the header) and had a total word count of around 500. Content was minimal, very rarely updated and the client was paying a monthly fee to host the site.

Whilst I'm still finding time to update this blog post, have a ganders at the current progress of the migration. <a href="https://ad-supplies.netlify.app" target="_blank">&rarr; AD Supplies &larr;</a>
