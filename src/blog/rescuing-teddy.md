Me and my girlfriend Beth moved into our first home in September 2020. We were so excited to move into our new build and begin the next chapter of our lives. We reserved the house at the start of 2019, but due to Covid, we faced so many delays.

On the flip side, this allowed us to save some extra cash in preparation for our big move in date. Before we knew it, it was time for us to move in.

A month into living here, we both decided the house would feel better with a **little** companion. We're both huge dog lovers and we have both grown up with dogs being apart of the household and family.

I've always wanted a Whippet, and my girlfriend has always wanted a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Like everything else during COVID, the price of buying a puppy was obscene. We decided to scout the local dogs homes online, and we came across Teddy, a 10 month old Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross with a Greyhound, aka a Lurcher. We fell in love with him straight away! He's been with us over a year now, and he truly is mans best friend.
